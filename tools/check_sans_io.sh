# tools/check_sans_io.sh -- enforce the sans-I/O parser-sublayer contract.
#
# The files listed in ``SANS_IO_FILES`` form the canonical pure-function
# parser surface re-exported by ``flare.http.proto``. They MUST NOT import
# from any of the I/O-bearing subsystems below. Adding a file to the list
# is a one-line edit; removing one is a deliberate signal that it has
# grown an I/O dependency and no longer belongs in the sans-I/O surface.
#
# Forbidden prefixes (with both ``from flare.X`` and ``from .X`` /
# ``from ..X`` flavours):
#
#   flare.runtime  -- reactor, scheduler, cancel, timer wheel, handoff,
#                     pools, blocking helpers, io_uring driver.
#   flare.io       -- BufReader (socket-bound reader).
#   flare.tcp / flare.udp / flare.uds -- socket types.
#   flare.tls      -- OpenSSL FFI bindings.
#   flare.net      -- socket address resolution helpers.
#
# Usage: ``pixi run check-sans-io`` (wired in pixi.toml).
#
# Exit code 0 = clean; non-zero = at least one forbidden import found.

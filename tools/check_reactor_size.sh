# tools/check_reactor_size.sh -- enforce file-size discipline in the
# reactor sub-package.
#
# After the v0.8 reactor decomposition (commits 1-4 of the v0.8
# blast plan), every file under ``flare/http/_reactor/`` should fit
# in a reviewer's working memory. The bar is **600 lines per file**:
# anything bigger means the next refactor missed a natural seam,
# and the duplication / divergence pressure that the decomposition
# pass undid is creeping back. The lint guards the gain.
#
# Usage: ``pixi run check-reactor-size`` (wired in pixi.toml).
#
# Threshold:
#   FLARE_REACTOR_MAX_LINES (default 600).
#
# Allowlist:
#   Files in ``ALLOWLIST`` are tracked + reported but do not fail the
#   lint. Each entry must carry a ``# TODO(track-N): split into ...``
#   comment in the source file pointing at the planned decomposition.
#   The allowlist is meant to **shrink to empty** as decomposition
#   work lands; a file leaves the allowlist by being split.
#
# Exit code 0 = clean (every file under threshold or on the
# allowlist), non-zero = at least one file is over threshold and not
# allowlisted.

# stays visible; a file leaves this list by being decomposed below
# the threshold (and the lint then enforces the bar on the result).

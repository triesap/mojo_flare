"""Per-connection state machine for the reactor-backed HTTP server.

Owns the per-connection buffer and walks a small state machine driven by
readable / writable / timeout events from the reactor. Never blocks on I/O;
instead consumes as much as the socket's non-blocking ``recv``/``send``
makes available per event and returns control to the reactor.

State transitions:

::

    STATE_READING ─ handler returned ─> STATE_WRITING ─ flushed ─┬─> STATE_READING (keep-alive)
                                                                └─> STATE_CLOSING (should_close)
    STATE_READING / STATE_WRITING ─ peer close / error / timeout ─> STATE_CLOSING

At a higher level the flow is:
  1. ``__init__`` — construct with the accepted fd and buffer sizing.
  2. Reactor event loop:
     - On readable: call ``on_readable(handler, config)``.
     - On writable: call ``on_writable()``.
     - On timeout: call ``on_timeout()``.
  3. Each call returns a ``StepResult`` telling the caller how to update
     reactor interest (read / write bits), whether to rearm the idle
     timer, and whether the connection is done.

The state machine deliberately does not own the reactor or timer wheel.
It exposes a thin step API so the reactor-backed ``HttpServer`` (Phase
1.5) owns the lifecycle while this module owns the per-conn logic.

        The caller (``run_uring_recv_reactor_loop``) gets the bytes
        from a ``URING_OP_RECV`` CQE (the kernel placed them in the
        per-conn buffer at SQE-submit time). We append them to

        / serialise / keep-alive bookkeeping as ``on_readable[H]``
        does after its drain-until-EAGAIN loop. The per-conn state
        machine is otherwise identical -- the only delta vs the
        epoll path is the source of bytes (kernel push vs userspace
        recv pull).

        The ``IORING_OP_RECV`` CQE with ``res == 0`` (peer closed)
        is handled by the caller, not here -- this method only
        runs when there are real bytes to feed.

                empty (legitimate when the kernel re-issues a

    multi-worker entry point. Functionally identical to

    1. ``listener_fd`` is borrowed from the ``Scheduler`` (the
       ``Scheduler`` owns the underlying ``TcpListener`` and closes
       it on shutdown). This worker never closes ``listener_fd``.
    2. The listener is registered with ``Reactor.register_exclusive``
       so the kernel sets ``EPOLLEXCLUSIVE`` on Linux (>= 4.5),
       waking only one worker per accept event. On macOS the flag
       is unavailable and registration falls back to plain
       ``register`` — the wakeup pattern degrades to "wake-all,
       one-wins" but practical behaviour is similar because
       non-blocking ``accept`` returns ``EAGAIN`` on the losers.

    The fairness improvement vs ``bind_reuseport`` is in the
    accept-time distribution: instead of the kernel hashing each
    new 4-tuple to one of N listeners (variance: a 256-conn storm
    can land 80+ on one worker, 30 on another), every new accept
    is offered to the worker that's currently waiting in
    ``epoll_wait``. Idle workers absorb spikes; busy workers
    aren't burdened with extra conns. The
    ``benchmark/configs/throughput_mc.yaml`` p99 collapses from
    seconds to milliseconds with this entry point (see
    ``the design notes``).

        listener_fd: Listener fd, owned by the ``Scheduler``. Must
            be in non-blocking mode before calling (the

    memcpy + the syscall pair, which scales near-linearly across
    cores.

    Args:
        listener_fd: Borrowed shared listener fd. Must be in
            non-blocking mode (the Scheduler does this once at
            bind-time). This worker never closes it.
        config: Per-worker copy of ``ServerConfig``.
        resp: Pre-encoded static response (immutable; safely shared
            across workers via ``StaticScheduler``'s heap-stored
            copy).
        stopping: Heap-allocated stop flag mutated by
            ``StaticScheduler.shutdown`` from the main thread.

# ── io_uring server-loop dispatch ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# When ``use_uring_backend()`` is true (Linux kernel exposes io_uring
# AND ``FLARE_DISABLE_IO_URING`` is unset), ``HttpServer.serve_static``
# routes through ``run_uring_reactor_loop_static`` below instead of
# the epoll/kqueue ``run_reactor_loop_static`` above.
#
# How it differs from the epoll path
# -----------------------------------
#
# * Backend: ``UringReactor`` (multishot accept on the listener,
#   multishot poll per connection fd) instead of ``Reactor``
#   (epoll_wait on Linux, kqueue on macOS). One ``io_uring_enter``
#   per loop iteration replaces ``epoll_wait`` + ``epoll_ctl(MOD)``
#   per modify; the multishot accept replaces the
#   ``while True: accept(); EAGAIN`` drain loop with one CQE per
#   accepted connection.
# * Per-conn state machine: **unchanged**. ``ConnHandle.on_readable_static``
#   and ``on_writable`` still do their own non-blocking ``recv`` /
#   ``send`` on the socket fd. The uring path only replaces the
#   *readiness notifier*: the kernel posts a ``URING_OP_POLL`` CQE
#   when the fd becomes readable / writable, and the dispatch loop
#   calls the same on_readable_static / on_writable code that the
#   epoll path runs. This keeps the wire-in surgical: zero changes
#   to the parser / response framer / keep-alive logic.
# * Cleanup: closing the connection fd implicitly cancels the
#   kernel's multishot poll on it. Any final-no-more-events CQE
#   that arrives after cleanup looks like a "conn_id not in dict"
#   miss in the dispatch switch and is silently ignored.
# * Modify (read <-> write): ``cancel_poll(fd) +
#   arm_poll_readable_multishot(fd, mask)`` is the io_uring
#   equivalent of ``epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD, fd, mask)``. We
#   trigger it from ``_apply_step_uring`` only when the new
#   interest mask actually differs from the currently-armed one,
#   matching the epoll path's no-op-skip optimisation.

# ── io_uring buffer-ring dispatch (handler path) ────────────────────────────
#
# Production handler-path io_uring loop using the kernel-managed buffer
# ring substrate: ``IORING_OP_RECV`` + ``IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT`` +
# ``IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT`` against a registered buffer group (set up via
# ``IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING`` on kernels >= 5.19, or
# ``IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS`` on older).
#
# How it works
# ------------
#
# This is the same pattern every Rust io_uring HTTP server (tokio-uring,
# monoio, glommio) uses:
#
#   1. At reactor startup, allocate a per-worker buffer pool of
#      N × 8 KiB and register it as a buffer group via
#      ``register_pbuf_ring(bgid, ring_entries)``. The kernel takes
#      ownership of the buffer ring; we keep the backing allocation
#      alive (free at reactor shutdown).
#   2. On each accept CQE, arm one IORING_OP_RECV +
#      IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT + IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT SQE with
#      buf_group=bgid. The kernel auto-rotates buffers from the
#      pool for every recv on this fd; one SQE per connection
#      drives an unbounded stream of recv CQEs.
#   3. On each recv CQE, the buffer id is in the CQE's flags
#      high 16 bits (IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER set). We compute the
#      buffer's address as ``pool + bid * BUF_SIZE``, feed the
#      bytes into ConnHandle.on_readable_from_buf[H], and recycle
#      the buffer back into the pool via a shared-memory tail bump
#      (PBUF_RING) or a one-shot PROVIDE_BUFFERS SQE (older
#      kernels).
#   4. On step_done, just free the conn (close fd; kernel cancels
#      any pending recv multishot SQE). No per-conn buffer to free
#      -- the buffer was already returned to the pool in step 3
#      (or will be returned by the kernel on the next CQE).
#
# Why MULTISHOT recv requires the buffer ring: without
# ``IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT``, IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT either errors out,
# fires once and stops, or unsafely reuses the user's single buffer
# across overlapping CQEs. ``IORING_OP_POLL_ADD``'s multishot mode is
# also unsuitable because its edge-triggered semantics race against
# the recv-EAGAIN drain pattern under back-to-back keep-alive.
#
# This eliminates per-conn buffer pinning AND drops the recv
# syscall per request (the kernel hands us bytes via the buffer
# ring), which is the principal io_uring performance unlock for
# the recv-side.
#
# Send path is synchronous ``on_writable`` using non-blocking
# ``_send``. ``UringReactor.submit_send`` is exposed as substrate
# for callers that want to land kernel-async sends on top of
# this dispatch.

# Generation-stamped conn_id encoding -- the fix for the

#
# When connection A on fd=8 closes, the kernel may have a
# trailing recv CQE in flight (the final-no-more-events CQE
# from the cancelled multishot recv) tagged with conn_id=8.
# If a new connection B is accepted on the *same* fd=8 before
# we see that stale CQE, our naive ``conn_id = fd`` scheme
# routes the stale CQE to B's freshly-armed recv state -- which
# either double-arms recv (kernel SIGSEGV territory) or feeds
# stale buffer-id data into B's parser. Generation-stamped
# conn_ids fix this: each accept bumps a per-worker monotonic
# generation counter, packs ``(gen << 24) | fd`` into the
# 56-bit conn_id space, and stores the conn under that full
# packed id. Stale CQEs from connection A carry the OLD gen
# bits and miss the ``if conn_id not in conns`` lookup --
# they're dropped cleanly, never touching connection B's
# state.
#
# 24-bit fd / 32-bit gen split: fd values fit in 24 bits even

# Benchmarks

Reproducible measurements with pinned toolchains, integrity-gated
baselines, and a 5-run median with stdev gate. The
[single-worker Linux plaintext table](#single-worker-linux-aws-epyc-7r32)
is the closest single number to a production-shape headline.

## Workload + harness shape

The headline harness is **wrk2 in calibrated-peak mode** against
a 13-byte plaintext body. Calibrated-peak means a four-phase
run: (1) a 5 s settle phase at a low fixed rate so JIT, branch
caches, and TCP slow-start are out of the way; (2) a brief
overdrive probe (`-R 10000000`) that establishes a ceiling;
(3) a five-step binary search for the highest fixed rate where
**p99 ≤ a configurable budget (default 50 ms) AND wrk2's
achieved rate is at least 90 % of the requested rate** — that
"achieved ≥ 90 %" rule rejects the case where the load gen has
piled up requests at its own queue while the server falls behind
(which is what overdrive-only peak-finders silently report as
peak); (4) five 30 s measurement rounds at 90 % of the
calibrated peak that report the latency distribution.

Calibrated-peak replaces the earlier "two-phase" harness. The
two-phase harness measured peak with one wrk2 overdrive run and
sustained at 90 % of *that* number; on a single-worker server the
overdrive-vs-sustainable gap was small (~10 %), but on a
multi-worker server the overdrive number over-reports the
sustainable peak by 30–60 % (the kernel's accept queue absorbs
the extra load briefly, then the server falls behind and tail
explodes). The calibrated-peak path closes that gap and is what
every multi-worker number in this document publishes.

wrk2 (rather than wrk) closes the
[coordinated-omission](https://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html)
hole that makes wrk's default mode silently inflate p99 and
hide p99.9 / p99.99 once the server is anywhere near capacity:
wrk2 sends at constant throughput so queue time at the gen is
counted, which is what production clients actually observe
under load.

1. **wrk2 + tail percentiles.** Every measurement run captures
   p50 / p75 / p90 / p99 / **p99.9 / p99.99 / p99.999** via
   `wrk2 --latency`. The summary headline req/s is **peak
   capacity** from the find-peak phase; the latency columns
   reflect tail behaviour at 90 %-of-peak sustained load. The
   `_install_wrk2.sh` step builds a pinned wrk2 commit when the
   platform has no conda-forge package (linux-64 today). Tail
   numbers are reproducible across machines because the
   toolchain is pinned in `[feature.bench.dependencies]`.

2. **Multiple workloads**, not one:

   - **`micro-static`** ([`throughput.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/throughput.yaml))
     — the per-core plaintext parity gate. The headline tables
     below.
   - **`mixed-keepalive`**
     ([`mixed_keepalive.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/mixed_keepalive.yaml)
     + [`wrk_mixed_keepalive.lua`](../benchmark/scripts/wrk_mixed_keepalive.lua))
     — 80 % keep-alive, 20 % `Connection: close`. Catches
     regressions in flare's keep-alive book-keeping and
     close-after disposition that pure keep-alive loads can't
     exercise. `pixi run --environment bench bench-mixed-keepalive`.
   - **`uploads`** ([`uploads.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/uploads.yaml))
     — POSTs of 4 KB / 64 KB / 1 MB / 16 MB. The 1 MB and 16 MB
     cases drive the zero-copy reactor adoption.
   - **`downloads`** ([`downloads.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/downloads.yaml))
     — GETs returning 4 KB / 64 KB / 1 MB / 16 MB streamed
     bodies. Headline target for the streaming-body reactor
     adoption: "no per-client allocation proportional to body
     size." The Go baseline serves matching `/4kb` / `/64kb` /
     `/1mb` / `/16mb` routes so the comparison is
     apples-to-apples.
   - **`slow-clients`** ([`slow_clients.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/slow_clients.yaml))
     — 256 connections, each trickling 1 byte / 100 ms.
     Validates that the `read_body_timeout_ms` deadline reclaims
     worker slots from slow-body DoS attempts.
   - **`churn`** ([`churn.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/churn.yaml))
     — 10 K open / send / close cycles per second. Stresses
     `accept()` throughput, the `Pool[ConnHandle]` allocator,
     and the kernel's ephemeral-port + TIME_WAIT bookkeeping.

## Server throughput (TFB plaintext)

The workload spec is `GET /plaintext` returning the 13-byte
body `Hello, World!` with `Content-Type: text/plain`,
HTTP/1.1 keep-alive on, no gzip, no logging. Mojo nightly is
pinned per the `[dependencies]` block in
[`pixi.toml`](../pixi.toml). Workload definitions live in
[`benchmark/configs/throughput.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/throughput.yaml).

The published headline numbers below are taken on the boxes
flare's release process targets (Apple M-series for the macOS
column, AWS EPYC 7R32 for the Linux column). Per-tag refreshes
land in the GitHub release notes for the matching tag; this
page tracks the methodology + most recent dev-box smoke.

### Single-worker, macOS Apple M-series

All rows are **single-worker** (`flare` 1 reactor, Go
`GOMAXPROCS=1`). This is the per-core request-processing
comparison; multi-worker numbers live in the next section.

| Server | Workers | Peak req/s | p50 | p99 | vs Go `net/http` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **flare (reactor)** | 1 | **157,459** | 0.39 ms | 0.80 ms | **1.10x** |
| Go `net/http` (`GOMAXPROCS=1`) | 1 | 143,500 | 0.44 ms | 0.86 ms | 1.00x |

flare is ~1.10x Go's stdlib `net/http` at the same worker count.

### Single-worker, Linux AWS EPYC 7R32

`Linux 6.8.0-1027-aws`, Mojo nightly, Go `1.24.13`, nginx `1.25.3`.
Different machine — absolute req/s is not comparable across the
macOS and Linux tables (different OS, scheduler, CPU); only the
intra-platform ratios are.

All rows are **single-worker** (flare 1 reactor, nginx
`worker_processes 1`, Go `GOMAXPROCS=1`).

| Server | Workers | Peak req/s | p50 | p99 | vs Go `net/http` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| nginx | 1 | 81,612 | 0.40 ms | 0.79 ms | 2.00x |
| **flare (reactor)** | 1 | **79,965** | 0.78 ms | 1.53 ms | **1.96x** |
| Go `net/http` (`GOMAXPROCS=1`) | 1 | 40,739 | 1.59 ms | 3.10 ms | 1.00x |

flare sits within 2 % of nginx's single-worker throughput and is
about 1.96x Go `net/http` per core. The flare-vs-Go ratio is wider
on Linux (1.96x vs 1.10x) because Go's scheduler and `netpoll`
overhead is a larger share of each request on the slower EPYC core
than on an Apple M-series P-core. Absolute req/s is lower on EPYC
for reasons independent of flare; see
[the platform footnote](#platform-footnote).

### Tail latencies under sustained load (dev-box smoke)

The wrk2 calibrated-peak harness produces full p50 / p99 / p99.9 /
p99.99 columns at 90 %-of-peak sustained load. Numbers below
are smoke-quality — taken on the maintainer's AWS Ubuntu 22.04
dev box (6 vCPU, glibc 2.35) at commit
[`9025444`](https://github.com/ehsanmok/flare/commit/9025444),
not the EPYC headline machine — but they prove the harness
works and demonstrate the tail-discipline shape flare's
release-tag numbers will carry.

| Workload | Server | Workers | Peak req/s | p50 (ms) | p99 (ms) | p99.9 (ms) | p99.99 (ms) | stdev% |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `throughput` | **flare** | 1 | **76,710** | **1.22** | **3.06** | **3.35** | **3.76** | 1.27 |
| `throughput` | Go `net/http` | 1 | 40,896 | 1.37 | 3.21 | 3.72 | 4.53 | 1.57 |
| `mixed_keepalive` | **flare** | 1 | **75,958** | **1.23** | **3.09** | **3.34** | **3.46** | 1.27 |
| `mixed_keepalive` | Go `net/http` | 1 | 41,027 | 1.38 | 3.22 | 3.77 | 4.57 | 1.57 |

Same single-worker discipline as the prior tables. flare
holds 1.87x Go's peak req/s; the tail stays disciplined out
to p99.99 (3.76 ms vs Go's 4.53 ms on `throughput`,
3.46 ms vs 4.57 ms on `mixed_keepalive`). The `mixed_keepalive`
configuration adds 20 % `Connection: close` to the load —
flare's close-after-disposition handling doesn't introduce
tail bumps. Both servers are stable under the 3 % stdev gate
across the 5-run measurement phase.

### Multi-worker scaling, Linux EPYC

**Worker-count discipline:** the tables below show two things,
kept in the same matrix so the reader can see the per-core
baseline (1-worker `flare`, 1-worker `nginx`, 1-worker Go) next
to the matched multicore comparison (4-worker `flare_mc` vs
4-worker `hyper`, `axum`, `actix_web`). Every row's worker count
is in the column header; we do not compute a `vs <X>` ratio
between rows whose worker counts differ. The Go baseline
(`benchmark/baselines/go_nethttp/main.go`) is hard-coded to
`runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)` and the nginx config to
`worker_processes 1` so those rows land in the per-core column;
the Rust baselines all run on a 4-worker tokio runtime / 4-worker
actix system, matching `flare_mc`.

`HttpServer.serve(handler, num_workers=N)` with `N >= 2` binds
**per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT` listeners** by default (each worker
owns its own listener fd; the kernel hashes new 4-tuples to one
of N listeners, matching actix_web's listener strategy and
giving the highest steady-state throughput on dev-box workloads).
Set `FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0` to opt into the alternative:
a single shared listener registered in every worker's reactor
with `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` (Linux >= 4.5). Under the shared-listener
mode the kernel wakes exactly one waiter per accept event in
FIFO order across workers blocked in `epoll_wait`, so a worker
actively running a handler is not woken -- fair-by-construction
across *idle* workers. That mode trades 7-22% req/s (handler vs
static fast path) for a uniformly tighter p99.99 σ under
sustained load; useful when the workload has bursty arrival
that can stack on one reuseport listener. See the
[Listener-mode A/B](#listener-mode-ab-flare-only) section for
the head-to-head numbers in both modes.

The load generator is
[`throughput_mc.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/throughput_mc.yaml)
(`wrk2 -t8 -c256 -d30s --latency`) with the calibrated
sustainable-peak harness from
[`bench_vs_baseline.sh`](../benchmark/scripts/bench_vs_baseline.sh).
The single-threaded `throughput.yaml` pins `wrk` to one thread and
64 connections, which cannot drive enough concurrent load to show
worker scaling no matter what the server does.

#### flare own worker scaling, EPYC 7R32, throughput_mc

| Server | Workers | Req/s (median) | stdev% | p50 | p99 | vs flare 1w |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| flare (single-threaded) | 1 | 56,086 | 0.32 | 1.21 ms | 2.70 ms | 1.00x |
| **flare_mc (per-worker SO_REUSEPORT, default)** | **4** | **170,305** | **0.17** | **1.13 ms** | **2.38 ms** | **3.04x** |

`flare_mc` scales to **3.04x of flare 1w** on 4 workers — slightly
super-linear once the single-worker reactor's serialization /
ack-batching overhead is amortised across cores.

#### Cross-framework comparison, EPYC 7R32, throughput_mc (8 wrk2 threads, 256 conns, --latency)

Every row labels its **server-side worker count** explicitly. The
single-worker rows (flare, nginx, Go) and the four-worker rows
(flare_mc, hyper, axum, actix_web) are kept in the same table
so the reader can see the per-core baseline next to the matched
multicore comparison. Median req/s is the wrk2 calibrated
sustainable-peak (p99 ≤ 50 ms gate, then 90 % of peak across 5x
30 s runs).

| Target | Workers | Req/s (median) | stdev% | p50 (ms) | p99 (ms) | p99.9 (ms) | p99.99 (ms) | stable |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| actix_web (tokio, `workers=4`) | 4 | 264,691 | 0.17 | 1.19 | 2.80 | **11.44** | **21.61** | true |
| hyper (tokio multi-thread) | 4 | 221,349 | 0.17 | 1.24 | 2.82 | 3.28 | 3.67 | true |
| axum (tokio multi-thread) | 4 | 201,042 | 0.21 | 1.29 | 2.82 | 3.27 | 3.65 | true |
| **flare_mc (per-worker SO_REUSEPORT, default)** | **4** | **170,305** | **0.17** | **1.13** | **2.38** | **2.73** | **3.11** | true |
| nginx (`worker_processes 1`) | 1 | 63,764 | 0.39 | 1.06 | 2.29 | 2.70 | 3.03 | true |
| **flare (reactor)** | **1** | **56,086** | **0.32** | **1.21** | **2.70** | **3.16** | **3.54** | true |
| Go `net/http` (`GOMAXPROCS=1`) | 1 | 35,940 | 0.21 | 1.12 | 2.92 | 4.29 | 5.47 | true |

Worker discipline:

- `flare_mc`, `hyper`, `axum`, `actix_web` all run **4 OS worker
  threads**. flare_mc and actix_web both default to per-worker
  `SO_REUSEPORT` listeners; hyper / axum share a listener via
  tokio's multi-thread runtime. `flare_mc` can be flipped to the
  shared-listener / `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` shape via
  `FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0` -- see the
  [Listener-mode A/B](#listener-mode-ab-flare-only) section.
- `flare`, `nginx`, `go_nethttp` all run **1 OS worker thread**.
  nginx via `worker_processes 1`, Go via `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)`,
  flare via the default single-reactor `serve(handler)` path.
- All targets are stress-tested by the same `wrk2 -t8 -c256 -d30s
  --latency` client against `127.0.0.1:8080/plaintext` over HTTP/1.1
  keep-alive on the same EPYC 7R32 box.

Reading order:

1. **flare_mc tail latency is the best of the four 4-worker
   frameworks.** p99 = 2.38 ms vs hyper 2.82 / axum 2.82 /
   actix_web 2.80; p99.99 = 3.11 ms vs hyper 3.67 / axum 3.65 /
   actix_web 21.61. This `flare_mc` row was measured in the
   shared-listener / `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` mode
   (`FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0`), which trades 7-22 % req/s for
   the tightest p99.99 σ -- see the
   [Listener-mode A/B](#listener-mode-ab-flare-only) section
   for both shapes against the same workload. actix_web's
   p99.99 spike is the per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT` listener-
   distribution variance wrk2's coordinated-omission correction
   picks up.
2. **Throughput: flare_mc lands at 64 % of the throughput
   leader** (170 K vs actix_web 265 K), 77 % of hyper 221 K, 85 %
   of axum 201 K. The remaining gap is per-request handler /
   serializer constant overhead — Mojo nightly's allocator and
   Mojo's `String` ref-count discipline are still measurably
   heavier than Rust's `Bytes::from_static` + `&'static [u8]`
   path. The 0.17 % stdev shows the gap is a steady cost, not
   tail variance.
3. **flare 1w vs nginx 1w: 88 % parity.** 56 K vs 64 K req/s on
   matched single-worker setups. nginx wins absolute throughput
   (it's a static-text fast path); flare's tail at p99 (2.70 ms
   vs 2.29 ms) and p99.99 (3.54 ms vs 3.03 ms) is in the same
   shape. flare runs a real Mojo handler (`req.url == "/plaintext"`
   branch + `ok("Hello, World!")` + Response serialization), not
   a hard-coded `return 200 "Hello, World!"`.
4. **flare 1w vs Go 1w: 1.56x throughput, comparable tail.** The
   Go scheduler / `netpoll` overhead is a meaningful fraction of
   each request on EPYC.
5. **stdev across 5 measurement runs is at or below 0.39 % for
   every published row** — well under the harness's 5 % stability
   gate. Numbers are coordinated-omission corrected.

On macOS loopback `flare_mc` saturates at ~140 K req/s regardless
of worker count because `wrk` and the server compete for the same
single-client CPU. That ceiling is the testbed, not flare. The
4-worker `flare_mc` row is within noise of the 1-worker flare row
on macOS — exactly why the Linux table above is the headline.

#### Why actix_web's p99.99 spikes (and flare_mc's doesn't)

actix_web ships with **per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT` listeners** by
default — every worker binds its own listener at the same port,
and the kernel hashes each new 4-tuple to one of N listeners.
Under bursty arrival (a wrk2 ramp opening 256 connections in
the first measurement window), the hash can cluster 80+
connections onto one worker and 30 onto another. The
overloaded worker head-of-line-blocks its share of the
connections while the other three sit idle; wrk2's
coordinated-omission correction surfaces that as p99.99
amplification.

hyper and axum share **a single listener** across the four
workers via tokio's multi-thread runtime; the `flare_mc` row
in the table above was measured in flare's shared-listener
shape:

- **flare_mc** (`FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0`) uses
  `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` (Linux ≥ 4.5) so the kernel wakes exactly
  one worker per accept event — whichever worker is currently
  parked in `epoll_wait`. Idle workers absorb spikes; busy
  workers aren't burdened with extra accepts.
- **hyper** + **axum** use tokio's multi-thread runtime which
  shares one accept future across worker tasks.

The shared-listener shape is what gives flare_mc / hyper / axum
their tight (3.11 / 3.67 / 3.65 ms) p99.99. actix_web's 21.61 ms
is the reuseport-distribution cost; switching actix_web to a
shared listener (it's a config knob) would close the gap. flare's
own default (per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT`) sits between the two
shapes -- see the next section for the head-to-head numbers.

### Same-host head-to-head (dev-box, current code)

The cross-framework table above is the historical CPU-pinned
reference run (raw run data not tracked in the repo; reproduce
locally via the harness below). The numbers in the README
headline come from a fresh **same-host head-to-head** on the
dev-box (also EPYC 7R32, separate AWS instance, no CPU
pinning) against the current code. Each row is measured
at its **peak-sustainable rate** -- the harness's calibrated-
peak finder picks the highest `R=` that holds `p99 ≤ 50 ms`,
runs five 30s rounds at 90% of that, reports the median.
The flare baselines build via `mojo build -D ASSERT=none`
(see [Production / bench build flags](#production--bench-build-flags));
the Rust baselines build via `cargo build --release --locked`.

**4-worker frameworks** (each row uses each framework's
default-recommended listener strategy: actix_web ships
per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT`; hyper and axum use tokio's
multi-thread runtime sharing one accept future; flare also
defaults to per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT` for `num_workers >= 2`):

Each latency cell is reported as `median ± σ` over the 5
measurement runs (σ = sample stdev across runs, ms;
Bessel-corrected). The `σ%` column is the relative stdev of
req/s across the same 5 runs (the harness's stability gate
fires at 3-5 % depending on config).

The σ on the tail percentiles is the **honesty meter** for
these numbers. A small σ (sub-ms on p99.9 / p99.99) means all
5 runs landed inside the steady-state working envelope. A
large σ (tens or hundreds of ms) means at least one of the 5
runs brushed against the saturation cliff and the headline
rate is sitting at the limit, not comfortably inside it. The
harness's calibration pass (probe duration 20 s, cliff-fanout
gate on p99.9 / p99.99, transient-blip retry, absolute-p99
growth gate, post-search 0.92× validation back-off) catches
the cliff at calibration time; what remains in the σ column
across these 4-worker rows is whatever residual variance each
framework has at its calibrated rate.

| Server | Workers | Req/s | σ%  | p50 (ms) | p99 (ms) | p99.9 (ms) | p99.99 (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| actix_web (tokio) | 4 | 252,671 | 0.22 | 1.22 ± 0.01 | 10.04 ± 4.55 | 27.15 ± 4.31 | 37.41 ± 18.49 |
| **flare_mc_static** (REUSEPORT) | **4** | **246,942** | **0.69** | **1.14 ± 0.08** | **2.68 ± 664.62** | **3.09 ± 676.39** | **17.50 ± 678.01** |

Source data:
[`benchmark/results/2026-05-27T2021-ehsan-dev-6e44e63/`](../benchmark/results/2026-05-27T2021-ehsan-dev-6e44e63/)
(all 4-worker rows, single multi-worker run with the
calibration harness, hot-path UTF-8 validation bypass
included; see [Hot-path measurement
notes](#hot-path-measurement-notes) below).

What jumps out:

- **flare_mc** (handler path) posts the best median p99 of
  the 4-worker pack at `2.63 ms`, edging hyper (`2.83 ms`)
  and matching axum (`2.80 ms`) while running on Mojo
  against three production-hardened Rust stacks. The σ on
  flare_mc's tail (`17–50 ms` across the 5×30 s runs at
  p99 / p99.9 / p99.99) is larger than axum's flat σ but
  smaller than hyper's at p99.99 — one of the five
  measurement runs brushed the working-envelope edge while
  the other four landed clean. The headline tightened by
  `+1.1 %` over the prior baseline (`212,246` → `214,567`
  req/s) after eliminating a redundant UTF-8 validation
  pass on the H1 parser's ASCII artifacts (`Method` /
  `Path` / `Version` / header names + values are already
  RFC 7230-validated by the byte-level parser before
  string materialisation). This is the row we hand
  operators when steady-state tail predictability matters
  more than headline throughput.
- **flare_mc_static** still leads on req/s of the
  multi-worker fixed-response fast paths (`247k req/s`,
  ~13 % under actix_web's new headline). Its p99 median is
  `2.68 ms` — tight when the harness lands inside the
  working envelope. The `~660 ms` σ at every tail
  percentile is the **honesty meter** firing: at this rate
  the fixed-response path occasionally tips off the
  saturation cliff, and the σ tells you that's where the
  next 10 % of throughput goes. Use this row when the
  headline matters and the workload tolerates occasional
  tail expansion; use `flare_mc` when you want a uniformly
  tight tail under sustained load.
- **actix_web** posts the highest headline (`253k req/s`)
  but its p99 median is `10.04 ms` and p99.99 is
  `37.41 ms` — the same cliff dynamic flare_mc_static
  shows, just at a higher rate. The σ on actix's p99 /
  p99.9 (`4.55 ms` / `4.31 ms`) is tight enough that this
  isn't measurement noise; it's a steady-state shape at
  that rate. The harness's calibration gate accepted the
  rate (the 20 s probe landed below the absolute-p99 limit
  the gate enforces) but the 5×30 s measurement rounds
  caught the steady-state shape underneath.
- **axum** is the steadiest of the pack: `195k req/s` with
  `σ ≤ 0.02 ms` at every tail percentile — flat at the
  cost of being the lowest headline of the four. It's the
  row you compare against when you want to know what an
  in-envelope p99 distribution looks like at the same
  load.
- **hyper** is the reference baseline — its v0.8 numbers
  (`216k req/s`, `2.83 ms` p99 median) move within
  `±0.5 %` of the prior measurement, which is what we
  want from the harness's calibration: the same Rust
  binary under the same Linux kernel returns the same
  throughput run-over-run.
- The harness's σ% column shows req/s itself is rock-steady
  at the 90 %-of-peak sustain rate (0.17-0.69 % across the
  5 runs for every framework), so the tail numbers are
  measuring real latency variance, not load-gen drift.

#### Hot-path measurement notes

The `+1.1 %` flare_mc tightening between the prior baseline
and the HEAD numbers above comes from a targeted hot-path
optimisation surfaced by the repeatable allocation +
CPU-profile harness shipped under `pixi run -e dev
perf-server-alloc` (Linux only;
[`benchmark/scripts/perf_profile_server.sh`](../benchmark/scripts/perf_profile_server.sh)).

The harness composes three measurements on the same
`bench_server` build (always built with `-D ASSERT=none`):

1. **heaptrack** — LD_PRELOAD malloc tracer. The healthy
   posture is every top entry coming from Mojo runtime
   startup (`M::MLRT::getOrCreateRuntime`) and the
   per-request hot path adding zero new allocation sites.
2. **`strace -c` on `brk` / `mmap` / `munmap` / `mremap`** —
   syscall-level allocator counts. The healthy posture is
   `total_syscalls / total_requests << 1.0` — measured
   posture is `171 syscalls / 600K requests = 0.00029
   syscalls/req`, all during startup, none on the
   per-request hot path.
3. **`perf record -F 999 --call-graph dwarf`** — sampling
   CPU profile of the live server. The healthy posture
   has the top user-space symbol as the parser body
   (`_parse_http_request_bytes`) at ~2-3 % of CPU. The
   prior profile flagged `_is_valid_utf8_runtime` at
   ~5 % — a Mojo-stdlib UTF-8 validator called by the
   `String(unsafe_from_utf8=Span)` constructor despite
   its name. Replacing the seven hot-path call sites with
   a non-validating helper that uses
   `String(unsafe_uninit_length=N)` + `memcpy` over
   pre-validated ASCII bytes recovers that 5 %, and the
   `+1.1 %` throughput delta is what's left after the
   reactor / syscall layer absorbs most of the win.

Both `valgrind` (`callgrind` / `massif` / `dhat`) and
`heaptrack` are pixi-managed via conda-forge on Linux-64
through `[feature.dev.target.linux-64.dependencies]`, so
the profile reproduces from a clean clone with `pixi
install -e dev`.

**Single-worker** (per-core request-processing cost, same
harness as the 4-worker rows above):

| Server | Workers | Req/s | σ%  | p50 (ms) | p99 (ms) | p99.9 (ms) | p99.99 (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| nginx (`worker_processes 1`) | 1 | 80,239 | 1.57 | 1.09 ± 0.02 | 3.45 ± 0.07 | 4.13 ± 0.11 | 4.80 ± 0.11 |
| **flare** (reactor) | **1** | **71,619** | **1.27** | **1.20 ± 0.02** | **3.01 ± 0.18** | **3.30 ± 1.49** | **3.43 ± 5.67** |
| Go `net/http` (`GOMAXPROCS=1`) | 1 | 40,173 | 1.57 | 1.38 ± 0.00 | 3.21 ± 0.01 | 3.74 ± 0.09 | 4.62 ± 0.32 |

flare 1w lands at 89 % of nginx's single-worker throughput
(71,619 vs 80,239) and posts a **tighter p99 than nginx**
(3.01 ± 0.18 ms vs 3.45 ± 0.07 ms) with comparable p99.9 /
p99.99 medians (3.30 / 3.43 ms vs nginx's 4.13 / 4.80 ms).
The σ on flare's p99.99 (5.67 ms) reflects that the harness
calibrated near the cliff for the single-worker path; the
median is still 1.37 ms tighter than nginx's, but one of
the 5 runs took a deeper outlier. vs Go `net/http` at the
same worker count: 1.78× the throughput, with both
showing tight tails -- Go has historically had wide tails
under GC pauses, and the harness's longer probe duration
(20 s) gives the runtime enough headroom that the GC pauses
are now amortised across the measurement window.
Source data:
[`benchmark/results/2026-05-11T1821-ehsan-dev-944de73/`](../benchmark/results/2026-05-11T1821-ehsan-dev-944de73/).

#### Listener-mode A/B (flare-only)

flare exposes both listener strategies so the operator can
choose between throughput and tail latency:

| flare path | Listener mode | Peak rps | p99.99 (ms) |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| flare_mc_static (default) | per-worker SO_REUSEPORT | 246,942 | 17.50 ± 678.01 |
| flare_mc_static + `FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0` | shared listener + EPOLLEXCLUSIVE | 214,306 (-13 %) | 3.26 (median) |
| flare_mc handler (default) | per-worker SO_REUSEPORT | 214,567 | 3.26 ± 50.52 |
| flare_mc handler + `FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0` | shared listener + EPOLLEXCLUSIVE | 196,757 (-8 %) | 3.23 (median) |

(The `default` rows are the HEAD numbers from the 4-worker
table above. The shared-listener rows are from the prior
historical reference at the same dev-box and are kept as a
within-noise comparison point; refresh against HEAD with
`FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0 pixi run -e bench
bench-vs-baseline --only flare_mc,flare_mc_static --configs
throughput_mc` if you need to re-validate the listener-mode
delta on your own dev-box.)

Picking a mode:

- **per-worker SO_REUSEPORT (default)** — each worker
  accept(2)s on its own fd, kernel hashes new 4-tuples to
  one of N listeners. Higher throughput on unpinned
  dev-boxes / high-core-count instances because each
  worker's accept loop is fully independent (no
  cross-worker EPOLLEXCLUSIVE wakeup overhead). Matches
  actix_web's listener strategy. This is what the headline
  "vs Rust libs" numbers above use.
- **EPOLLEXCLUSIVE shared listener (`FLARE_REUSEPORT_WORKERS=0`)** —
  the kernel offers each accept event to whichever worker
  is currently parked in `epoll_wait`. Idle workers absorb
  spikes; busy workers aren't burdened with extra accepts.
  Strictly tighter p99.99 σ under sustained load (3.23 ms
  median in the historical CPU-pinned reference, where
  actix_web's per-worker reuseport hits 21.61 ms p99.99
  from listener-distribution variance). Trades 7-22 % req/s
  (handler vs static fast path) for that tighter tail.

**1-worker frameworks** (single-thread reactor / event loop):

| Server | Workers | Peak rps | p99 (ms) | p99.99 (ms) | R= used |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| nginx (`worker_processes 1`) | 1 | 68,875 | 2.95 | 3.59 | 70,000 |
| **flare** (reactor) | **1** | 52,147 | 2.79 | **3.46** | 53,000 |
| Go `net/http` (`GOMAXPROCS=1`) | 1 | 34,439 | 2.98 | 4.70 | 35,000 |

Single-worker comparison: flare 1w sustains 76 % of nginx 1w
throughput (was 88 % on the historical CPU-pinned reference)
and 1.51x of Go 1w (was 1.56x). nginx's tight C event loop
loses less to dev-box scheduler noise than flare's reactor
does, so the gap widens on the unpinned dev-box. flare keeps
the tightest p99 / p99.99 in the single-worker pack:
3.46 ms vs nginx 3.59 / Go 4.70.

Reading order:

1. **Tail latency: flare wins** at both p99 and p99.99 of the
   five 4-worker frameworks. flare_mc handler is 3.23 ms
   p99.99 vs actix_web 3.43 / hyper 3.70 / axum 3.74. The
   ~3 ms p99.99 floor is the dev-box scheduler-noise floor;
   inside that floor, flare's per-request hot path is at
   least as quiet as the rust frameworks' equivalents.
2. **Throughput: actix_web leads the dev-box.** 248K vs
   flare_mc_static 214K (-14 %) vs flare_mc handler 197K
   (-21 %). actix_web's per-worker `SO_REUSEPORT` listeners
   (which inflated p99.99 on the historical CPU-pinned run)
   actually help it on the unpinned dev-box: the kernel
   spreads load across the four listeners directly without
   waking idle workers through `epoll_wait`.
3. **flare is at parity with hyper / axum** on throughput.
   flare_mc_static slightly beats hyper (214K vs 209K, +3 %)
   and clearly beats axum (214K vs 190K, +13 %). flare_mc
   handler beats axum (197K vs 190K) and trails hyper
   slightly (197K vs 209K, -6 %).
4. **The historical CPU-pinned numbers are still the
   reference for tail latency.** flare_mc on the CPU-pinned
   EPYC reference holds p99.99 = 3.11 ms — even tighter than
   the 3.23 ms above. The 9-of-flare improvements documented
   in the next section don't touch the dispatch-loop or
   accept fairness, so the CPU-pinned tail shape carries
   forward.

### Methodology: peak-sustainable vs saturate-mode

`wrk2 -R<rate>` is a **target-rate** generator. If the server
keeps up, you get `<rate>` req/s with bounded tail latency.
If the server can't keep up, requests queue inside `wrk2`'s
HdrHistogram and the coordinated-omission correction
amplifies the tail by the queueing time — so a server
pushed past saturation reports req/s near its true peak but
p99.99 in the **hundreds of ms or seconds**, not because of
a real tail bug, but because the cliff was crossed.

The table above is **peak-sustainable**: the cliff was found
by sweeping `R=` upward, and the reported row is the highest
`R=` that holds `p99.99 ≤ 5 ms` (≈2× the dev-box noise
floor). One step above each row's `R=` and the same server's
p99.99 jumps to 100 ms+ — the cliff is sharp, not gradual.

| Server | Last tight-tail row | First post-cliff row |
|---|---|---|
| flare_mc_static (REUSEPORT) | R=260K → p99.99 = 3.54 ms | R=270K → p99.99 = 383 ms |
| actix_web | R=250K → p99.99 = 3.43 ms | R=260K → p99.99 = 69.57 ms |
| flare_mc handler (REUSEPORT) | R=240K → p99.99 = 3.47 ms | R=245K → p99.99 = 584 ms |
| hyper | R=210K → p99.99 = 3.70 ms | R=220K → p99.99 = 35.46 ms |
| axum | R=195K → p99.99 = 3.74 ms | R=210K → p99.99 = 451 ms |
| flare_mc_static (default) | R=220K → p99.99 = 3.26 ms | R=245K → p99.99 = 1.07 s |
| flare_mc handler (default) | R=200K → p99.99 = 3.23 ms | R=205K → p99.99 = 1.49 s |
| flare 1w | R=53K → p99.99 = 3.46 ms | R=55K → p99.99 = 186 ms |
| nginx 1w | R=70K → p99.99 = 3.59 ms | R=73K → p99.99 = 1.69 s |
| Go 1w | R=35K → p99.99 = 4.70 ms | R=40K → p99.99 = 24.99 ms |

**This is why bench harnesses that auto-calibrate `R=` from
a coarse probe land different rows on different sides of the
cliff and produce noisy comparisons.** The peak-sustainable
operating point is the only honest single-rate number for a
given server on a given host.

### What changed under the hood

The improvements above are five concrete code changes:

| What | How | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Per-request parser cost | New `_parse_http_request_bytes_minimal` skips `HeaderMap` build entirely when the handler doesn't read headers; opt-in via `ServerConfig.skip_header_decode_for_short_requests` | [`flare/http/server.mojo`](../flare/http/server.mojo), [`flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo`](../flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo) |
| Per-request keep-alive policy | `_connection_is_keepalive` / `_connection_is_close` byte fast-paths replace the per-request `_ascii_lower` allocation for canonical `Connection: keep-alive` / `close` | [`flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo`](../flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo) |
| Read-buffer compaction | `_compact_read_buf_drop_prefix` replaces 5 inlined per-byte append loops with a single `memcpy` shift | [`flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo`](../flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo) |
| Fixed-response specialisation | `HttpServer.serve_static_multicore(resp, num_workers=N)` runs the static fast path under `StaticScheduler` — `recv -> _scan_content_length -> memcpy(resp.bytes) -> send`, no parser / handler / Response alloc | [`flare/http/server.mojo`](../flare/http/server.mojo), [`flare/runtime/scheduler.mojo`](../flare/runtime/scheduler.mojo), [`flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo`](../flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo) |
| io_uring substrate completeness | `IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING` (2.7x kernel-bench faster than PROVIDE_BUFFERS), `IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT` routing fix (was silently degrading to oneshot), `IORING_SETUP_*` flag plumbing (COOP_TASKRUN / DEFER_TASKRUN / SINGLE_ISSUER / SUBMIT_ALL), peek-then-block `UringReactor.poll`, `enable_wakeup=False` mode for single-issuer rings | [`flare/runtime/io_uring_sqe.mojo`](../flare/runtime/io_uring_sqe.mojo), [`flare/runtime/io_uring_driver.mojo`](../flare/runtime/io_uring_driver.mojo), [`flare/runtime/uring_reactor.mojo`](../flare/runtime/uring_reactor.mojo) |

### Reproducibility

`hyper`, `axum`, `actix_web`, `nginx`, `go_nethttp` baselines all
live under [`benchmark/baselines/`](../benchmark/baselines), pinned
via `Cargo.lock` (Rust frameworks), conda-forge `nginx 1.25` and
`go 1.24`. Raw run data (env, integrity gate, per-target JSON, raw
wrk2 stdout) lands under `benchmark/results/<timestamp>-<host>-<commit>/`
when you reproduce locally; results aren't tracked in the repo.

Reproduce on a Linux box with ≥ 8 physical cores:

```bash
pixi run --environment bench bash benchmark/scripts/bench_vs_baseline.sh \
    --only=flare,flare_mc,hyper,axum,actix_web,nginx,go_nethttp \
    --configs=throughput_mc
```

Worker counts default to 4 for `flare_mc` (`FLARE_BENCH_WORKERS=4`)
and to whatever is hard-coded in each baseline's run script (1 for
nginx / Go, 4 for the Rust frameworks). Override `flare_mc` with
`FLARE_BENCH_WORKERS=N` to scale; the bench harness re-runs the
peak-finder at the new worker count automatically.

### Production / bench build flags

The headline numbers above use the same compiler posture as
the Rust baselines: full `-O3` optimisation with all
`debug_assert` calls compiled out. That's what `cargo build
--release --locked` produces for actix_web / hyper / axum, and
what flare's bench harness does via:

```bash
mojo build -D ASSERT=none -I . benchmark/baselines/flare_mc/main.mojo \
    -o target/bench_baselines/flare_mc
./target/bench_baselines/flare_mc
```

(`mojo build` defaults to `-O3`; `-D ASSERT=none` compiles out
every `debug_assert[assert_mode="safe"]` call -- the FFI-boundary
safety asserts that the Mojo stdlib default `ASSERT=safe` keeps
in the binary. See [`docs/build.md`](build.md) for the full
assert-mode hierarchy + the sanitizer harness.)

For production deployments, **use the same shape**: build
with `mojo build -D ASSERT=none` and run the resulting binary.
The `mojo run my_app.mojo` JIT path keeps the safety asserts
on, which is fine for development (catches use-after-free,
EBADF, EFAULT in the FFI layer before they become silent
kernel-mode UB) but adds a measurable per-event tax on the
reactor hot path. Bench numbers and production traffic see
the same posture only when both build with `-D ASSERT=none`.

The dev-time flow stays simple: `pixi run tests`, the
sanitizer harnesses, every example -- they all run under
the default `ASSERT=safe`. Only the `bench-vs-baseline*`
tasks and production deployments need the no-asserts build.

### Platform footnote

Three things about the Linux column are deliberate, not "flare can
only hit 80K/s in production":

1. **`GOMAXPROCS=1`, `worker_processes 1`, and single-thread flare.**
   Every baseline runs on one logical core so the comparison is
   apples-to-apples about per-core request-processing cost. This
   models the cheapest hosting tier (one vCPU) rather than peak
   throughput on the box. Production deployments on either platform
   should scale with worker count (nginx, Go) or with `SO_REUSEPORT`
   sharding (flare).
2. **`wrk` and the server are not CPU-pinned.** On a 64-vCPU AWS
   instance the Linux scheduler migrates both processes across cores
   between slices, causing L1/L2 misses and occasional SMT-sibling
   contention. Pinning `wrk` and the server to two different
   physical cores on the same NUMA node typically recovers 15 to
   30 % for Go on EPYC (a known `net/http` behaviour on
   shared-scheduler Linux, which is also where the flare-vs-Go ratio
   shift between the two platforms comes from). The harness
   intentionally does not pin so the numbers match an un-tuned
   deployment.
3. **c5-class EC2 does not turbo like M-series.** Single-thread
   throughput on EPYC 7R32 is roughly half of an Apple M-series
   P-core for HTTP plaintext. That is microarchitecture, not a
   scheduler or runtime property. flare and nginx both drop by about
   2x between the two tables; Go drops by about 3.5x because its
   goroutine plus `netpoll` overhead is a bigger percentage of each
   request on the slower core.

---

## Soak: long-running operational gates

The throughput tables above answer "is it fast right now". The
soak harness answers "is it still alive at 4 a.m. on day 2".
Three operational signals microbenchmarks miss:

- **RSS over time** — does memory grow linearly, plateau, or
  spike under churn?
- **File descriptors** — are accept-loop / TLS / connection
  bookkeeping leaking fds under churn?
- **Tail-latency drift** — does p99 stay flat at hour 24 or does
  a slow pathology creep in?

### Three tiers, one harness

The driver lives in
[`benchmark/scripts/_run_soak.sh`](../benchmark/scripts/_run_soak.sh).
A single set of scripts runs at three tiers via the
`SOAK_DURATION_SECS` env knob (defaults to 60 s):

| Tier | Per-workload duration | Total wall time | When to run |
|---|---|---|---|
| **smoke** | 60 s | ~3 min | PR / iterative dev (`pixi run --environment bench bench-soak-smoke`) |
| **extended** | 300 s | ~15 min | Before pushing larger changes (`pixi run --environment bench bench-soak-extended`) |
| **release gate** | 86 400 s (24 h) | ~24 h per workload, ~3 days serial | Linux EPYC, manual one-shot pre-tag |

Release-gate invocation pattern (one workload per box-day, run
serially or in parallel on different EPYC boxes):

```bash
SOAK_DURATION_SECS=86400 pixi run --environment bench bench-soak-slow-clients
SOAK_DURATION_SECS=86400 pixi run --environment bench bench-soak-churn
SOAK_DURATION_SECS=86400 pixi run --environment bench bench-soak-mixed
```

Same `_run_soak.sh` driver, same `summary.json` schema, same gate
logic — only the duration changes. The 24 h gate is the
release-blocking one; smoke and extended are catch-loud-failures
filters.

### Workloads + gates

All three workloads target `/plaintext` on the flare bench server
boot from
[`benchmark/baselines/flare/main.mojo`](../benchmark/baselines/flare/main.mojo)
— the **same** entry point the bench-vs-baseline throughput
harness uses, so soak numbers are directly comparable to the
single-worker throughput tables above. The wrk lua scripts live
in
[`benchmark/scripts/wrk_soak_*.lua`](../benchmark/scripts/).

#### slow-client

256 concurrent connections, each issuing a short POST request
every ~100 ms (wrk's `delay()` model is the closest approximation
to "1 byte / 100 ms" inside wrk's protocol shape). Gate:

- **`pass = errors == 0 && rss_end <= 2 * rss_start`**
- 24 h release-gate variant additionally requires `rss_end ≈
  rss_start` after the first hour (RSS-flat).

The lua approximation does not byte-trickle inside a single
request body the way a true byte-trickle harness would; the
`read_body_timeout_ms` deadline path is exercised end-to-end in
[`tests/http/test_server_deadlines.mojo`](../tests/http/test_server_deadlines.mojo)
instead. Soak covers the resource-exhaustion shape (many
connections held under pressure).

#### churn

64 concurrent connections, every request sets `Connection: close`
so the server closes after each response. wrk reopens for the
next request. Effective rate is bounded by ephemeral-port
turnover. Gate:

- **`pass = errors == 0 && fd_end <= fd_start + 16`**
- 16-fd slack covers timer / wakeup / log fds beyond the
  per-connection fds. The `fd_end` measurement happens after a
  3 s post-wrk drain pause so in-flight connections finish their
  close handshake before the observer's last sample.

#### mixed

64 concurrent connections, ~20 % tagged with `Connection: close`
(every 5th request), the remaining 80 % standard HTTP/1.1
keep-alive. Catches regressions in the connection-disposition
path that pure keep-alive load doesn't exercise. Gate:

- **`pass = errors == 0 && rss_end <= 2 * rss_start`**

### Output schema

Each per-workload run writes
`build/soak/<workload>/<timestamp>-<host>-<commit>/summary.json`
with the following fields. The schema is stable so EPYC release-
gate runs can be aggregated by per-tag publication tooling without
script edits:

```json

```

Companion files in the same directory:

- `wrk.txt` — raw wrk stdout including the latency distribution.
- `observe.jsonl` — per-second (or per-5-s for the 24 h tier)
  RSS / fd-count samples. One JSON object per line:
  `{"ts_ms": 12345, "rss_kb": ..., "hwm_kb": ..., "peak_kb":
  ..., "fd_count": ...}`.
- `server.{stdout,stderr}` — flare bench server output.
- `observer.stderr` — observer-side stderr.

### Dev-box smoke + extended results (Ubuntu 22.04, 6 vCPU AWS)

These are NOT release-gate numbers. They are smoke artefacts
captured on the maintainer's AWS Ubuntu 22.04 dev box (glibc
2.35, x86_64) at commit
[`9755049`](https://github.com/ehsanmok/flare/commit/9755049).
The release-gate p99.9 / p99.99 numbers + 24 h flat-RSS proof are
captured on Linux EPYC and live in the per-tag release notes.

What the tables prove on this hardware: the harness fires
cleanly, the gates evaluate against real data, and the dev-box
server holds steady under all three workloads at the smoke +
extended durations (no crashes, no fd leaks, RSS within ~1 % of
cold-start across both tiers).

Two cross-tier observations:

- **RSS deltas are essentially identical** between smoke (60 s)
  and extended (300 s): ~0.5–1.5 MB across all three workloads
  in both tiers. A 5x duration increase did not produce a 5x
  RSS increase — per-request allocator churn is bounded rather
  than leaking. The 24 h gate is what pins this assertion
  long-term.
- **fd_count returns to baseline** in both tiers across all
  workloads (`fd_end == fd_start == 55`). The 3 s post-wrk drain
  pause documented at the top of
  [`_run_soak.sh`](../benchmark/scripts/_run_soak.sh) is what
  makes this measurement honest — without it the observer
  would race wrk-exit and report ~30–250 in-flight fds as a
  false-positive "leak".

### Limitations

- **Linux only.** `/proc/<pid>/status` is the RSS source; macOS
  would need `ps -o rss=` fallback. The release gate runs on
  Linux EPYC anyway.
- **wrk-driven slow-client is an approximation** — see the
  slow-client section above. The byte-trickle path is exercised
  by unit tests instead.
- **The smoke and extended tiers cannot prove "RSS flat after 1
  hour"** — that signal lives only in the 24 h release-gate
  run. Smoke / extended catch only loud failures (server died,
  RSS doubled, fds leaked beyond a small constant).

## Methodology

The TFB plaintext workload (TechEmpower test #6) is `GET /plaintext`
returning the 13-byte body `Hello, World!` with `Content-Type:
text/plain`, HTTP/1.1 keep-alive on, no gzip, no logging.

Measurement rules:

- **Response-byte integrity:** before any measurement round, each
  baseline is probed once and its response bytes are diffed against
  the workload spec. A target producing a different status, body
  length, or non-whitelisted header is **rejected** before the
  measurement starts. Headers allowed to vary per target: `Date`,
  `Server`, `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`.
- **Pinned toolchains:** Go and nginx pin to `[feature.bench.
  dependencies]`; the conda-forge `wrk` package is on PATH for
  ad-hoc use; **wrk2** is built from a pinned commit by
  `bench-install-wrk2` (the harness drives wrk2 explicitly via
  `build/wrk2/wrk2`, not whatever `wrk` is on PATH).
- **Calibrated-peak wrk2** (see
  [Workload + harness shape](#workload--harness-shape) above for
  the full four-phase description): a 5 s settle, an overdrive
  probe, a five-step binary search for the highest fixed rate
  that holds `p99 ≤ 50 ms` AND `achieved ≥ 90 % of requested`,
  then five 30 s measurement rounds at 90 % of that calibrated
  peak. Stability gate fires at 3 % stdev on req/s across the
  measurement rounds.
- **Load generator:** wrk2 with `--latency` for the headline
  bench (CO-corrected tail percentiles up to p99.999). The
  conda-forge `wrk` package is still on PATH for ad-hoc use.
  Never `ab` or `h2load`, for consistency with published
  TFB-style numbers. Two configs ship today —
  [`throughput.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/throughput.yaml) (`-t1
  -c64 -d30s`) for per-core request-processing cost, and
  [`throughput_mc.yaml`](../benchmark/configs/throughput_mc.yaml)
  (`-t8 -c256 -d30s`) for saturating a thread-per-core server. Server
  and `wrk` run on the same host over loopback.
- **Per-run provenance:** every run writes its own directory under
  `benchmark/results/<yyyy-mm-ddTHHMM>-<host>-<git-sha>/` containing
  `env.json` (CPU model, OS, kernel tunables, exact toolchain
  versions), `integrity.md`, per-tuple result JSONs, `summary.md`,
  and raw `wrk` stdout under `RAW/`.

This protocol (integrity check, pinned toolchains, 5-run median with
stdev gate) is stricter than TFB's own single 15 s round on shared
hardware. It is closer to the reproducibility setups in
[simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/performance.md)
and [rapidjson](https://rapidjson.org/md_doc_performance.html).

## HTTP parsing microbenchmark

Apple M-series (`pixi run bench-compare`):

| Operation | Latency |
|---|---|
| Parse HTTP request (headers + body) | 1.7 us |
| Parse HTTP response | 2.2 us |
| Encode HTTP request | 0.7 us |
| Encode HTTP response | 0.9 us |
| Header serialization | 0.12 us |

On EPYC 7R32 (Linux, AVX2) the same ops are about 1.4x slower
per-op (e.g. request parse 2.35 us, response parse 6.45 us),
consistent with the single-core throughput gap in the
server-throughput tables above. Run `pixi run bench-compare` on
either platform to reproduce.

A reminder from the criticism: a parser is not the bottleneck on a
13-byte response. The microbenchmark is useful as a guard against
parser regressions, not as a headline.

## WebSocket SIMD masking

RFC 6455 requires XOR-masking every client-to-server byte. SIMD gives
a 14-35x speedup for payloads above 128 bytes.

Apple M-series (NEON, SIMD-32):

| Payload | Scalar | SIMD-32 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 KB | 3.2 GB/s | 112.6 GB/s |
| 64 KB | 3.4 GB/s | 47.8 GB/s |
| 1 MB | 3.4 GB/s | 54.8 GB/s |

EPYC 7R32 (Linux, AVX2, SIMD-32) is in the same regime — peak
90.6 GB/s at 1 KB (58x scalar), 52.8 GB/s at 64 KB, 34.7 GB/s at
1 MB — about 20 % under Apple M-series at the L1-resident sizes
and within noise at the L2/L3-resident sizes.

## Reproduce locally

```bash
# Throughput + tail percentiles (the single-worker headline numbers above)
pixi run --environment bench bench-install-wrk2        # one-time build (pinned wrk2 commit)
pixi run --environment bench bench-vs-baseline-quick   # flare vs go_nethttp on throughput, fastest path
pixi run --environment bench bench-vs-baseline         # full sweep: all baselines x configs the script defaults to

# Mixed-keepalive (80% keep-alive, 20% close) — flare vs go_nethttp on the mixed_keepalive config
pixi run --environment bench bench-mixed-keepalive

# Ad-hoc tail percentile probe (no integrity check, no 5-run gate)
pixi run --environment bench bench-tail-quick          # wrk2 --latency at fixed rate

# TLS bench setup (self-signed cert under build/tls-bench-certs/)
pixi run --environment bench bench-tls-setup
```

The TLS bench configs `tls_plaintext.yaml` (steady-state TLS
throughput, connections kept open) and `tls_handshake.yaml`
(handshake-per-request, `Connection: close`) are wired into the
harness and drive a TLS-terminating flare server on
`127.0.0.1:8443`. These configs use the blocking
`handshake_fd(fd)` path; a non-blocking reactor-state-machine TLS
handshake that ties them into the cancel-aware reactor loop is
gated on a Mojo improvement.

Results land under `benchmark/results/<timestamp>-<host>-<commit>/`.

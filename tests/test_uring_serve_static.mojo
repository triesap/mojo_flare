"""Integration test for the io_uring server-loop dispatch.

When ``flare.runtime.uring_reactor.use_uring_backend()`` returns True,
``HttpServer.serve_static`` routes through
``run_uring_reactor_loop_static`` (in ``flare.http._server_reactor_impl``)
instead of the epoll/kqueue ``run_reactor_loop_static``. This file
boots a real server on the io_uring path, fires a real HTTP/1.1 GET
over loopback, and asserts the response carries the precomputed body.

Topology (mirrors ``tests/test_tls.mojo`` so we reuse the same
fork(2)-based pattern):

    Parent: TCP client (assertions live here).
    Child:  ``HttpServer.serve_static`` (exits via ``_exit(0)`` after
            the parent sends ``SIGKILL`` post-assertion).

Linux + io_uring-only. On macOS or on Linux kernels that pre-date
io_uring, the lone test is skipped (logged, not asserted) so the
test-server battery still passes everywhere.

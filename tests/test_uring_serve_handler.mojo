"""Integration test for the io_uring buffer-ring handler-path
wire-in.

When :func:`flare.runtime.uring_reactor.use_uring_backend` returns
True, ``HttpServer.serve(handler)`` routes through
``run_uring_bufring_reactor_loop[H]`` (in
``flare.http._server_reactor_impl``) -- the kernel-managed
buffer-ring recv-multishot dispatch that supersedes the two
reverted attempts (poll-multishot in ``c8cd770``, recv-multishot
in ``981eb8e``). This file boots a real server on the io_uring
handler path and validates two scenarios that surface the bugs
those reverted attempts hit:

1. **Sequential keep-alive churn** (the recv-multishot 981eb8e
   ConnHandle lifecycle bug at request #62 reproducer): one
   client opens 8 connections in a row, fires 50 keep-alive
   requests on each, closes between conns. Validates that the
   kernel-managed buffer ring fully eliminates the per-conn
   buffer pinning that triggered the lifecycle bug.

2. **Concurrent fan-out** (the buffer-ring 9cf97d0 SIGSEGV
   reproducer): 8 client conns in parallel, 50 requests each.
   Validates that the cancel-before-free fix in
   ``_cleanup_conn_uring_br`` eliminates the kernel race
   between conn close and reaccept on the same fd.

Topology mirrors :mod:`tests.test_uring_serve_static`: parent
runs the TCP clients + assertions, child runs
``HttpServer.serve(handler)`` and is SIGKILL'd at the end.
Linux + io_uring-only; skipped on macOS or kernels that don't
expose io_uring.

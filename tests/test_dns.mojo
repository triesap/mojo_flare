"""Tests for flare.dns — hostname resolution via getaddrinfo.

Covers:
- Successful resolution of known hosts (localhost, loopback numeric)
- IPv4-only and IPv6-aware resolution paths
- Numeric IP passthrough (inet_pton shortcut)
- Edge cases: empty host, excessively long hostname, trailing dot (FQDN)
- Security: null-byte injection, CRLF injection must raise, not silently truncate
- Error propagation: non-existent domain raises DnsError with context

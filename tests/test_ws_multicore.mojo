"""Smoke test for multi-worker :meth:`flare.ws.WsServer.serve(handler, num_workers=N)`.

Forks a child running ``WsServer.serve(echo_handler, num_workers=4)``
on a fixed loopback port, opens 4 concurrent ``WsClient`` echoes
in a loop from the parent (one per round), and verifies the
round-trip works end-to-end. The kernel hashes the new 4-tuples
across the SO_REUSEPORT listener set, so the test exercises the
fan-out path without needing per-worker observation.

The "concurrent" part is sequential here on purpose: spawning
multiple ``WsClient`` from a single Mojo thread is enough to
prove the multi-worker server's accept loops are all live; a
proper concurrency test would need ``pthread`` plumbing on the
client side that flare doesn't ship.

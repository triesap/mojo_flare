"""Regression: h2c-via-Upgrade client must not double-count the
response body when the server's reply lands in a single recv blob.

The bug (Mojo `1.0.0b1` Span-lifetime tightening): the client read
loop in :func:`flare.http.client._h2c_upgrade_request_via_stream`
fed each recv chunk into the in-process HTTP/2 decoder via
``Span[UInt8, _](buf[:n])``. ``buf[:n]`` allocates a temporary
``List`` whose backing storage was destroyed before
``h2_conn.feed`` returned under 1.0.0b1's stricter destructor
scheduling, so the heap could re-publish the slot to the same
``read`` call's next iteration -- doubling the response body the
next time the loop appended into ``buf``. Fixed by feeding via
``Span[UInt8, _](ptr=buf.unsafe_ptr(), length=n)`` so the
lifetime is the named ``buf``, which lives across the loop.

This regression fixture pins the fix:

* :func:`test_post_body_not_doubled` -- a POST with a 12-byte
  request body should round-trip a 28-byte response (``POST:12``
  echoed). Asserts both the value and the length so a future
  doubling regression hits a clearer error than ``"POST:12POST:12"
  != "POST:12"``.
* :func:`test_get_response_length_invariant` -- a GET on a handler
  that returns a body whose length is a power-of-two byte string.
  Doubling would yield a 2x-length response, so a strict length
  assertion is the simplest single-bit regression guard.
